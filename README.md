## Quickstart

To generate your dataset with custom classes, you need to execute only two commands:

```bash
pip install datadreamer
datadreamer --class_names person moon robot
```

## Overview

`DataDreamer` is an advanced toolkit engineered to facilitate the development of edge AI models, irrespective of initial data availability. Distinctive features of DataDreamer include:

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Eliminate the dependency on extensive datasets for AI training. DataDreamer empowers users to generate synthetic datasets from the ground up, utilizing advanced AI algorithms capable of producing high-quality, diverse images.

- **Knowledge Extraction from Foundational Models**: `DataDreamer` leverages the latent knowledge embedded within sophisticated, pre-trained AI models. This capability allows for the transfer of expansive understanding from these "Foundation models" to smaller, custom-built models, enhancing their capabilities significantly.

- **Efficient and Potent Models**: The primary objective of `DataDreamer` is to enable the creation of compact models that are both size-efficient for integration into any device and robust in performance for specialized tasks.

## Usage

The `datadreamer/pipelines/generate_dataset_from_scratch.py` (`datadreamer` command) script is a powerful tool for generating and annotating images with specific objects. It uses advanced models to both create images and accurately annotate them with bounding boxes for designated objects.

Run the following command in your terminal to use the script:

```bash
datadreamer --save_dir <directory> --class_names <objects> --prompts_number <number> [additional options]
```

### Example

```bash
datadreamer --save_dir path/to/save_directory --class_names person moon robot --prompts_number 20 --prompt_generator simple --num_objects_range 1 3 --image_generator sdxl-turbo
```

This command generates images for the specified objects, saving them and their annotations in the given directory. The script allows customization of the generation process through various parameters, adapting to different needs and hardware configurations.

<a name="output"></a>

### Output

The dataset comprises two primary components: images and their corresponding annotations, stored as JSON files.

```bash

save_dir/
│
├── image_1.jpg
├── image_2.jpg
├── ...
├── image_n.jpg
├── prompts.json
└── annotations.json
```

<a name="annotations-format"></a>

### Annotations Format

1. Detection Annotations (detection_annotations.json):

- Each entry corresponds to an image and contains bounding boxes and labels for objects in the image.
- Format:

```bash
{
  "image_path": {
    "boxes": [[x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max], ...],
    "labels": [label_index, ...]
  },
  ...
  "class_names": ["class1", "class2", ...]
}
```

2. Classification Annotations (classification_annotations.json):

- Each entry corresponds to an image and contains labels for the image.
- Format:

```bash
{
  "image_path": {
    "labels": [label_index, ...]
  },
  ...
  "class_names": ["class1", "class2", ...]
}
```

### Note

Please make sure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that the datadreamer package is properly set up in your Python environment before running the script.

<a name="limitations"></a>

## Limitations

While the datadreamer library leverages advanced Generative models to synthesize datasets and Foundation models for annotation, there are inherent limitations to consider:

- `Incomplete Object Representation`: Occasionally, the generative models might not include all desired objects in the synthetic images. This could result from the complexity of the scene or limitations within the model's learned patterns.

- `Annotation Accuracy`: The annotations created by foundation computer vision models may not always be precise. These models strive for accuracy, but like all automated systems, they are not infallible and can sometimes produce erroneous or ambiguous labels.

Despite these limitations, the datasets created by datadreamer provide a valuable foundation for developing and training models, especially for edge computing scenarios where data availability is often a challenge. The synthetic and annotated data should be seen as a stepping stone, granting a significant head start in the model development process.
